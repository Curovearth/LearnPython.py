    A curated list of important points for my reference.\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Objects are the core things that Python programs manipulate. Every object has a type that defines the kinds of things that programs can do with that object.
        \item An \textbf{Abstract Data type} is a set of objects and the operations on those objects.
        \item The two powerful mechanisms for managing the complexity of programming are 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Decomposition $\rightarrow$ Creates the structure of the program
            \item Abstraction $\rightarrow$ Suppresses the detail
        \end{itemize}   
        \item One implements data abstractions using \textbf{classes}.     
        \item [:] is a slice syntax for every element in the array.
        \item When a function definition occurs within a class definition, the defined function is called as \textbf{method} and is associated with the class. These methods are sometimes referred to as \textbf{method attributes} of the class.
        \item Class supports 2 kinds of operations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Instantiation} is used to create instances of the class. 
            
            For ex., the statement s = IntSet() creates a new object of type IntSet. This object is called an Instance of IntSet.
            \item \textbf{Attribute References} use dot notations to access attributes associated with the class. For ex., s.member refers to the method member associated with the instance s of type IntSet.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Whenever a class is instantiated, a call is made to the \textunderscore\textunderscore init\textunderscore\textunderscore method defined in that class.
        \begin{verbatim}
            s=IntSet()
            s.insert(3)
            print(s.member(3))
        \end{verbatim}
        creates a new instance of IntSet, inserts the integer 3 into that IntSet, and then prints true.
        \item When data attributes are associated with a class we call them \textbf{Class variables}. When they are associated with an instance we call them \textbf{instance variables}.
        \item All instances of user-defined classes are hashable, and therefore can be used as dictionary keys.
        \item What actually \textbf{Hashable} means in python? Ref: \href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/why-and-how-are-python-functions-hashable/}{Geeks for Geeks}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item hashable is a feature of Python objects that tells if the object has a hash value or not.
            \item If the object has a hash value then it can be used as a key for a dictionary or as an element in a set.
            \item An object is hashable if it has a hash value that does not change during its entire lifetime.
            \item Python has a built-in hash method ( \textunderscore\textunderscore hash\textunderscore\textunderscore() ) that can be compared to other objects.
            \item if the hashable objects are equal then they have the same hash value.
            \item All immutable built-in objects in Python are hashable like tuples while the mutable containers like lists and dictionaries are not hashable. An example below
            \begin{verbatim}
        t1 = (1, 5, 6)
        t2 = (1, 5, 6)
        # show the id of object
        print(id(t1))
        print(id(t2))

        1954294958784
            \end{verbatim}
        \end{itemize}
        \item Abstract Data Types
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  An abstract data type is a type with associated operations, but whose representation is hidden.
            \item They lead to a different way of thinking about organising large programs.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Data Objects $\rightarrow$ A data object is a region of storage that contains a value or group of values.
    \end{enumerate}
