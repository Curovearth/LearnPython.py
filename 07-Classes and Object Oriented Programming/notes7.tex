    A curated list of important points for my reference.\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Objects are the core things that Python programs manipulate. Every object has a type that defines the kinds of things that programs can do with that object.
        \item An \textbf{Abstract Data type} is a set of objects and the operations on those objects.
        \item The two powerful mechanisms for managing the complexity of programming are 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Decomposition $\rightarrow$ Creates the structure of the program
            \item Abstraction $\rightarrow$ Suppresses the detail
        \end{itemize}   
        \item One implements data abstractions using \textbf{classes}.     
    \end{enumerate}
