    A curated list of important points for my reference.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Multiline comments
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Triple quoted text should not be considered multi-line comments; by convention, they are docstrings
                \item Additional comment styles add unnecessary complications and could decrease readability
                \item Guido Tweet: You can use multi-line strings as multi-line comments. Unless used as docstrings, they generate no code.
                \item Triple quotes are treated as regular strings with the exception that they can span multiple lines. 
                By regular strings I mean that if they are not assigned to a variable they will be immediately garbage collected as soon as that code executes. 
                Hence are not ignored by the interpreter in the same way that #a comment is.
            \end{itemize}
        \item Ctrl + C terminates the infinite looping 
        \item Modern computers are amazingly fast. It takes on the order of one nanosecond-one billionth of a second-to execute an instruction.
        \item The range function takes three integer arguments: start, stop, step
        \item Exhaustive Enumeration Algorithm = Variant of guess and check. We enumerate all possibilites until we get to the right answer or exhaust the space of possibilities.
    \end{enumerate}
