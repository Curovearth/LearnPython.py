# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-285=2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
